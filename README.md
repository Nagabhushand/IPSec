# IPSec

This project aims to simulate and configure an IPsec site-to-site VPN using GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3).

The network involves multiple network devices to establish a secure and encrypted connection between two remote sites. 

The primary objectives include configuring routers using IPsec protocols (such as ESP and AH), implementing secure tunnelling, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between the simulated sites.
